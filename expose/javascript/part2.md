1. It will print prices.length because i is incremented up to prices.length.
2. It will print the unrounded value of the last element multiplied by 1 minus the value of discount because the loop runs in order and the value is left over.
3. It will print the rounded value of the last element multiplied by 1 minus the value of discount because the loop runs in order and the value is left over.
4. It returns an array of all the rounded values of prices multiplied by 1 minus the value of discount because all the values get pushed into discounted after they are multiplied and rounded. This will be [50, 100, 150].
5. It causes an error because there is no i in the scope.
6. It causes an error because there is no discounted price in the scope.
7. It will print the rounded value of the last element multiplied by 1 minus the value of discount because the loop runs in order and the value is available in scope.
8. It returns an array of all the rounded values of prices multiplied by 1 minus the value of discount because all the values get pushed into discounted after they are multiplied and rounded. This will be [50, 100, 150].
9. It causes an error because there is no i in the scope.
10. It prints out the value of prices.length.
11. It returns an array of all the values of prices multiplied by 1 minus the value of discount because all the values get pushed into discounted after they are multiplied. This will be [50, 100, 150].
